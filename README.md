From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Farkle, or Farkel, is a dice game similar to or synonymous with 1000/5000/10000, Cosmic Wimpout, Greed, Hot Dice,[1] Squelch,[2] Zilch,[3] or Zonk. Its origins as a folk game are unknown, but the game dates back to at least the mid-1980s.[4] It has been marketed commercially since 1996 under the brand name Pocket Farkel by Legendary Games Inc.[5][6] While the basic rules are well-established, there is a wide range of variation in both scoring and play.[1][6][7][8][9]

** Equipment
5 dices
Paper and a pencil or pen for keeping score


** Play
Farkle is played by two or more players, with each player in succession having a turn at throwing the dice. Each player's turn results in a score, and the scores for each player accumulate to some winning total (usually 10,000).

At the beginning of each turn, the player throws all the dice at once.
After each throw, one or more scoring dice must be set aside (see sections on scoring below).
The player bank the score accumulated so far, or continue to throw the remaining dice if not farkled.

If none of the dice score in any given throw, the player has "farkled" and all points for that turn are lost.
At the end of the player's turn, the dice are handed to the next player in succession (usually in clockwise rotation, viewing the table from above), and they have their turn.
Once a player has achieved a winning point total, each other player has one last turn to score enough points to surpass that high-score.

Standard scoring
The following scores for single dice or combinations of dice are widely established, in that they are common to all or nearly all of the above-cited descriptions of farkle scoring.

Each 1          	100
Each 5          	50

Three 3s	        300
